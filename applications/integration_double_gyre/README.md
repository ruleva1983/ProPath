# Description

This application allows to build network matrices for a double gyre system. This is a toy dynamical system
added here to allow the user to fast build some matrices on which to apply the pathfinding algorithms.

The only editable file should be the "integration_dg.cpp" where constants can be changed as well the 
dimension of the grid and time steps of integration.

To fast run the application, build it from the main directory, then run

./Integrate_Double_Gyre  M /path/where/to/save/the/matrices

A more detailed description will come later
